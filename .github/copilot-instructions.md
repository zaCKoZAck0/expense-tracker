- Always add comments to complex logic.
- Never use 'any' type in TypeScript; prefer specific types or generics.
- Always refactor large components into smaller, reusable components.
- Use error boundaries to handle errors in React components.
- Before creating a new component or utility, check if one already exists in the codebase.
- Don't unnecessarily override styles to existing components, only do when absolutely needed.
- Use shadcn components variants instead of creating new styled or overriding base components.
- Build mobile-first and ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.
- Always insure security best practices when handling user data and authentication.
- Prefer documentation over instinct when making decisions.
- Cleanup unused imports, unused logic and unused variables to maintain code clarity.
  – Don't use next.js router, treat the application as a single page app, use React state management with query params instead.
  - Delete files (using rm command) and code that are no longer needed or used in the project.
